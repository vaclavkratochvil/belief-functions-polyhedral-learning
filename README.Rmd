output: github_document

# Overview

This repository contains supplementary materials accompanying the paper

**M. Daniel, R. Jiroušek, V. Kratochvíl**  
*On Learning Belief Functions from Data Using Confidence Bounds*

The goal of this repository is to ensure **computational transparency and reproducibility**
of the numerical examples and optimization procedures presented in the paper.

---

# Content

The repository includes:

- **R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file** [Kybernetika manuscript](https://github.com/vaclavkratochvil/belief-functions-polyhedral-learning/blob/main/Kybernetika.md) implementing:
  - computation of Jeffreys confidence interval lower bounds,
  - construction of pseudo-belief functions from data,
  - upper approximation of pseudo-belief functions by belief functions,
  - linear programming formulations for selecting representative belief functions.
- Compiled **HTML/PDF outputs** corresponding to the supplementary material.

---

# Implementation

All computations are implemented in **R** using standard libraries.

Main technologies:
- **R (version ≥ 4.2)**
- **R Markdown**
- Base R statistical functions (`qbeta`)
- Linear programming solvers (e.g. `lpSolve`)

All computations are deterministic; no stochastic components are used.

# How to Run

You can use one of the following two options.

## Local execution using RStudio
1. Open the project in **RStudio**.
2. Open the main supplementary `.Rmd` file.
3. Click **Knit** (HTML or PDF), or run the document using `rmarkdown::render()`.
```r
rmarkdown::render("Kybernetika.Rmd")
```

The compiled output will be generated automatically.

Alternatively, individual code chunks can be executed interactively.
This allows users to:
- run selected parts of the analysis step by step,
- modify input values or confidence levels,
- organize the code into custom test scenarios.

Each code chunk is self-contained and can be evaluated independently in RStudio
using the *Run Current Chunk* or *Run All Chunks* options.

## Binder

An interactive **RStudio environment** for reproducing the results is also available via Binder:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vaclavkratochvil/belief-functions-polyhedral-learning/main?urlpath=rstudio&filepath=Kybernetika.Rmd
)

The Binder link opens RStudio with the main manuscript file (`Kybernetika.Rmd`)
preloaded. The results can be reproduced by clicking *Knit* or by running
individual code chunks interactively.
